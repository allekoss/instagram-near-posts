# Instagram Near Posts
Shows Instagram posts that were published near your current location.

A simple app where people can see what Instagram post have been posted near their area.
The search will be defaulted to 500 meters around the users current location but the app should allow the user to extend the search radius. The app should also automatically search a wider area if there are no results found near the user.

# Note

The Instagram App is in Sandbox Mode, so for being able to test it you need to have some sandbox users on your account.
